          <p class="bio">
            Alan Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in London. In his seminal 1936 paper, he proved
            that there cannot exist any universal algorithmic method of determining truth in
            mathematics, and that mathematics will always contain undecidable propositions. That
            paper also introduced the "Turing machine. His papers on the subject are widely
            acknowledged as the foundation of research in artificial intelligence.

          <h2 class="subtitle">Early Life</h2>
          <p class="bio">
            English scientist Alan Turing was born Alan Mathison Turing on June 23, 1912, in Maida
            Vale, London, England. At a young age, he displayed signs of high intelligence, which
            some of his teachers recognized, but did not necessarily respect. When Turing attended
            the well-known independent Sherborne School at the age of 13, he became particularly
            interested in math and science.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            After Sherborne, Turing enrolled at King's College (University of Cambridge) in
            Cambridge, England, studying there from 1931 to 1934. As a result of his dissertation,
            in which he proved the central limit theorem, Turing was elected a fellow at the school
            upon his graduation.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            In 1936, Turing delivered a paper, "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the
            Entscheidungsproblem," in which he presented the notion of a universal machine (later
            called the “Universal Turing Machine," and then the "Turing machine") capable of
            computing anything that is computable: The central concept of the modern computer was
            based on Turing’s paper.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            Over the next two years, Turing studied mathematics and cryptology at the Institute for
            Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. After receiving his Ph.D. from Princeton
            University in 1938, he returned to Cambridge, and then took a part-time position with
            the Government Code and Cypher School, a British code-breaking organization.

          <h2 class="subtitle">Cryptanalysis and Early Computers</h2>
          <p class="bio">
            During World War II, Turing was a leading participant in wartime code-breaking,
            particularly that of German ciphers. He worked at Bletchley Park, the GCCS wartime
            station, where he made five major advances in the field of cryptanalysis, including
            specifying the bombe, an electromechanical device used to help decipher German Enigma
            encrypted signals. Turing’s contributions to the code-breaking process didn’t stop
            there: He also wrote two papers about mathematical approaches to code-breaking, which
            became such important assets to the Code and Cypher School (later known as the
            Government Communications Headquarters) that the GCHQ waited until April 2012 to release
            them to the National Archives of the United Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            Turing moved to London in the mid-1940s, and began working for the National Physical
            Laboratory. Among his most notable contributions while working at the facility, Turing
            led the design work for the Automatic Computing Engine and ultimately created a
            groundbreaking blueprint for store-program computers. Though a complete version of the
            ACE was never built, its concept has been used as a model by tech corporations worldwide
            for several years, influencing the design of the English Electric DEUCE and the American
            Bendix G-15—credited by many in the tech industry as the world’s first personal
            computer—among other computer models.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            Turing went on to hold high-ranking positions in the mathematics department and later
            the computing laboratory at the University of Manchester in the late 1940s. He first
            addressed the issue of artificial intelligence in his 1950 paper, "Computing machinery
            and intelligence," and proposed an experiment known as the “Turing Test”—an effort to
            create an intelligence design standard for the tech industry. Over the past several
            decades, the test has significantly influenced debates over artificial intelligence.

          <h2 class="subtitle">Homosexuality, Conviction and Death</h2>
          <p class="bio">
            Homosexuality was illegal in the United Kingdom in the early 1950s, so when Turing
            admitted to police—who he called to his house after a break-in—in January, 1952, that he
            had had a sexual relationship with the perpetrator, 19-year-old Arnold Murray, he was
            charged with gross indecency. Following his arrest, Turing was forced to choose between
            temporary probation on the condition that he receive hormonal treatment for libido
            reduction, or imprisonment. He chose the former, and soon underwent chemical castration
            through injections of a synthetic estrogen hormone for a year, which eventually rendered
            him impotent.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            As a result of his conviction, Turing's security clearance was removed and he was barred
            from continuing his work with cryptography at the GCCS, which had become the GCHQ in
            1946.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            Turing died on June 7, 1954. Following a postmortem exam, it was determined that the
            cause of death was cyanide poisoning. The remains of an apple were found next to the
            body, though no apple parts were found in his stomach. The autopsy reported that "four
            ounces of fluid which smelled strongly of bitter almonds, as does a solution of cyanide"
            was found in the stomach. Trace smell of bitter almonds was also reported in vital
            organs. The autopsy concluded that the cause of death was asphyxia due to cyanide
            poisoning and ruled a suicide.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            In a June 2012 BBC article, philosophy professor and Turing expert Jack Copeland argued
            that Turing's death may have been an accident: The apple was never tested for cyanide,
            nothing in the accounts of Turing's last days suggested he was suicidal and Turing had
            cyanide in his house for chemical experiments he conducted in his spare room.

          <h2 class="subtitle">Awards, Recognition and Royal Pardon</h2>
          <p class="bio">
            Shortly after World War II, Alan Turing was awarded an Order of the British Empire for
            his work. For what would have been his 86th birthday, Turing biographer Andrew Hodges
            unveiled an official English Heritage blue plaque at his childhood home. In June 2007, a
            life-size statue of Turing was unveiled at Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire, England.
            A bronze statue of Turing was unveiled at the University of Surrey on October 28, 2004,
            to mark the 50th anniversary of his death. Additionally, the Princeton University Alumni
            Weekly named Turing the second most significant alumnus in the history of the school -
            James Madison held the number 1 position.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            Turing was honored in a number of other ways, particularly in the city of Manchester,
            where he worked toward the end of his life. In 1999, Time magazine named him one of its
            "100 Most Important People of the 20th century," saying, "The fact remains that everyone
            who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working
            on an incarnation of a Turing machine." Turing was also ranked 21st on the BBC
            nationwide poll of the "100 Greatest Britons" in 2002. By and large, Turing has been
            recognized for his impact on computer science, with many crediting him as the "founder"
            of the field.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            Following a petition started by John Graham-Cumming, then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown
            released a statement on September 10, 2009 on behalf of the British government, which
            posthumously apologized to Turing for prosecuting him as a homosexual. "Thousands of
            people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the
            appalling way he was treated," Brown wrote in the statement. "While Turing was dealt
            with under the law of the time and we can't put the clock back, his treatment was of
            course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and
            we all are for what happened to him.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            "This recognition of Alan's status as one of Britain's most famous victims of homophobia
            is another step towards equality and long overdue. But even more than that, Alan
            deserves recognition for his contribution to humankind," Brown stated. "It is thanks to
            men and women who were totally committed to fighting fascism, people like Alan Turing,
            that the horrors of the Holocaust and of total war are part of Europe's history and not
            Europe's present. So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely
            thanks to Alan's work I am very proud to say: we're sorry, you deserved so much better."
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II posthumously granted Turing a rare royal pardon almost 60
            years after he committed suicide. Three years later, on October 20, 2016, the British
            government announced “Turing’s Law” to posthumously pardon thousands of gay and bisexual
            men who were convicted for homosexual acts when it was considered a crime. According to
            a statement issued by Justice Minister Sam Gyimah, the law also automatically pardons
            living people who were “convicted of historical sexual offenses who would be innocent of
            any crime today.
